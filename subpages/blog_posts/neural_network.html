            [2023-07-03] 
            <p>I'm trying to improve my knowledge on backpropogation. I feel like my currrnt understanding relies too much on "black-box" abstractions. </p>
            <p>So the next best step? Build a simple NN from scratch. You can follow my progress <a href="https://github.com/sh2002vk/infancy">here.</a> </p>
            <p>Update: I was going to implement it in Cpp but I think to improve the probability I actually complete the
            project, it's better for me to start with python and focus more on how nets work instead of debugging memory dumps all the time.</p>
